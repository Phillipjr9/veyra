# Veyra

A high-fidelity demo banking product: marketing site, personal & business dashboards,
cards, transfers, invoicing, Scout AI savings, statements, a Super Admin console —
and a 25-template transactional email system — built on one design system.

> **Fictional product.** No real accounts, cards or payments. Banking copy is
> illustrative only.

## Stack

- **React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 7** (single-file production build via `vite-plugin-singlefile`)
- **Tailwind CSS 4** (preflight only) + hand-written semantic CSS design system
- **Motion** (animation), **Recharts** (charts), **lucide-react** (icons)
- **react-router-dom v7** (HashRouter), localStorage persistence (no backend)

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

### Demo logins (password: `123456`)

| Account | Email | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| Business | `demo@veyra.com` | Full business dashboard: cards, invoices, team, statements |
| Personal | `personal@veyra.com` | Personal banking: everyday debit, savings pockets |
| Super Admin | `admin@veyra.com` | `/app/superadmin` console: users, ledger, KYC requests, email studio |

The login screen has one-tap buttons that fill any of these.

## Design system

Defined once in `src/index.css` (`:root` tokens) and reused everywhere:

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--display` | Manrope | Headings, numbers, logo wordmark |
| `--body` | DM Sans | Body copy, UI labels |
| `--paper` | `#f5f2eb` | Page background |
| `--violet` | `#7558dc` | Primary accent |
| `--ink` | `#18171d` | Text, primary buttons |

Shared component styles live in `src/styles/*.css` (`dashboard`, `admin`,
`statements`, `scout`, `flow`, `emails`). When adding features, reuse these
classes and tokens — don't introduce new fonts or one-off colors.

```

## Email system

- `src/emails/design.ts` mirrors the app tokens as email-safe inline HTML
  (Manrope/DM Sans via web fonts + system fallbacks, hosted PNG logo).
- `src/emails/templates.ts` covers every notification the product generates:
  security, transfers, cards, invoicing, Scout and account lifecycle.
- Preview in-app at `#/email-templates` (desktop/mobile toggle, copy HTML) or
  open `email-showcase.html` for all 24 rendered in one page.

```bash
npm run build:emails   # export templates to emails/*.html
```

Before wiring a sending provider (SendGrid/Postmail/Mailgun), set `ASSET_BASE`
and `APP_BASE` in `src/emails/design.ts` to your real domains.

## KYC / identity verification flow

1. Admin requests verification: **SuperAdmin → Users → Request KYC** (choose
   documents + reason shown to the member).
2. The member sees a non-dismissible alert banner atop every dashboard page
   (who requested, why, which documents) with a **Verify identity** CTA.
3. The member completes a 3-step wizard (details → documents → review & submit)
   at `/app/kyc` (also reachable via ⌘K and Security Center). The submission
   (details + uploaded documents) is stored on the account.
4. The submission lands in **SuperAdmin → KYC Queue**: review the full
   submission, then **Approve** (limits unlock, member notified) or
   **Request changes** (member's banner shows the admin's note).
5. Status is visible to the admin in the user directory (`peekKycForUser`).

State lives in `KycRecord` (`src/lib/store.tsx`); `requestKycForUser()` writes
the request cross-account with an in-app notification.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev            # dev server
npm run build          # production build → dist/index.html (single file)
npm run build:emails   # export email templates → emails/*.html
npm test               # KYC flow tests + email link/tag validation
```
